Since I missed heating up, I didn't know what memoization was, so Mr. Blick also explained that to me for some time. I came up with an idea that was kind of based off of the idea of permutations that I wanted to keep thinking about when I got home. I think it would likely work just very inefficiently. |

Basically, it would be to take a similar approach to spelling bee from CS2 where you would start with a 'priority coin' and would do as many of that coin as possible and then go down the list afterwards. Then, that coin's number would get reduced by one each time and you would switch the priority coin around so that everyhting had a chance. I also started to dive deeper into dynamic programming so that I could make sure I was really on top of what I had missed. |

I wanted to try the dynamic programming technique, so I came up with the base case and tried to come up with a recursive formula. I think that it would work to essentially use the coin or skip the coin, but I am not sure how to code that yet, so I just implemented the base case for now. |
| Jan 25 | 8:30-9:15pm   | I think I am going to ask Mr. Blick to meet because I definitely don't feel as comfortable as I would want to be with the concepts I missed while I was sick. However, for my best guess, I think that I could use memoization here and have it store the results based on the target number and your current index. I implemented a 2D to act as a memo table and store the calculated values where the indices are based on the target and the index as I just explained. I don't really know how I would code out my permutation idea so I am going to wait for Mr. Blick to teach us the theory in class but I'm hoping that my memoization table is somewhat correct in how we are supposed to make it. |
