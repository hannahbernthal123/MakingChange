| Jan 23 | 11:15-11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       During this time in class, we spent a good amount of time thinking through the problem set and what could be solutions based on what we already know. Since I missed heating up, I didn't know what memoization was, so Mr. Blick also explained that to me for some time. I came up with an idea that was kind of based off of the idea of permutations that I wanted to keep thinking about when I got home. I think it would likely work just very inefficiently. |
| Jan 24 | 10:00-10:45am |                                                                                                                                                                          While at home I wanted to keep exploring the permutation idea that I had come up with in class. Basically, it would be to take a similar approach to spelling bee from CS2 where you would start with a 'priority coin' and would do as many of that coin as possible and then go down the list afterwards. Then, that coin's number would get reduced by one each time and you would switch the priority coin around so that everyhting had a chance. I also started to dive deeper into dynamic programming so that I could make sure I was really on top of what I had missed. |

I wanted to try the dynamic programming technique, so I came up with the base case and tried to come up with a recursive formula. I think that it would work to essentially use the coin or skip the coin, but I am not sure how to code that yet, so I just implemented the base case for now. |
| Jan 25 |  8:30-9:15pm  | I think I am going to ask Mr. Blick to meet because I definitely don't feel as comfortable as I would want to be with the concepts I missed while I was sick. However, for my best guess, I think that I could use memoization here and have it store the results based on the target number and your current index. I implemented a 2D to act as a memo table and store the calculated values where the indices are based on the target and the index as I just explained. I don't really know how I would code out my permutation idea so I am going to wait for Mr. Blick to teach us the theory in class but I'm hoping that my memoization table is somewhat correct in how we are supposed to make it. I also watched one more video on memoization. |

I also started thinking about what I would put in my helper function for the recursion. To be honest, this wasn't a very productive 45 minutes, but I will get more work done next time! |
| Jan 30 |  1:00-1:30pm  |                                    During this chunk, I completed memoization! I was confused at first about how you actually save the memoizations so that was causing me issues, but then I put it in between the lines that are actually calling the recursion and it worked great! What the actual recursive calls were wasn't difficult to figure out, especially because we did so much with the slides and in class, so that part was easy to implement. The last part that was causing me issues was I was individually adding each call of the recursive function that I called on each coin, but I realized that is fundamentally wrong because the helper function itself gooes through all of the coins, so it was even easier than I thought! |
| Jan 30 |  1:30-1:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                                  I then finished tabulation! I was getting really tripped up on things being out of bounds but I knew that I didn't want to pad the array, so it just took some trial and error with the +1s and -1s etc. It ended up basically just being two bounds checks where when it was in bounds, you update the table accordingly. For tabulation, I also created variables to represent the spot to the left that you look at and the spot above that you look at so I can add up those values in the table and sum them to get any given spot. I am going to add documentation and then submit! |
